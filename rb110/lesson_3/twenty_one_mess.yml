rules: "\nThe goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. \nIf you go over 21, it's a 'bust' and you lose."
rules_2: "\nSetup: the game consists of a 'dealer' and a 'player'. \nBoth participants are initially dealt 2 cards from a normal deck of cards. \nThe player can see their 2 cards, but can only see one of the dealer's cards."
rules_3: "\nCard values: all of the card values are pretty straightforward, except for the ace. \nThe numbers 2 through 10 are worth their face value. \nThe jack, queen, and king are each worth 10, \nand the ace can be worth 1 or 11."
rules_4: "You goes first, and can decide to either 'hit' or 'stay'. A hit means you ask for another card. You may hit as many times as you want. The turn is over when you either bust (get more than 21 points) or stay. If the player busts, the game is over and the dealer won."
