    <h1>Hello, Internet</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my website! It&#8217;s a work in progress as I learn <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> from a <em>terrific</em> class I&#8217;m taking at <a href="www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I&#8217;m learning a lot! Why don&#8217;t you join me?</p>

    <p class="main">There&#8217;s not a lot of material on this page as I&#8217;m playing around with HTML &#38; CSS. When I&#8217;m done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first &#8211; the "class" attribute on the two &#60;p&#62; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.</p>

    <p class="main" id="conclusion">This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.</p>
  </body>
