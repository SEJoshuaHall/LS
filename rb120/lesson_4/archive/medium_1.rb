Question 1
Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end
Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

"Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an @!"

Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

Ben, a reader method was defined.

Question 2
Alan created the following code to keep track of items for a shopping cart application he's writing:

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    # prevent negative quantities from being set
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
Alyssa looked at the code and spotted a mistake. "This will fail when update_quantity is called", she says.

Can you spot the mistake and how to address it?
quantity is being reset at each initialization
we need a new class variable to track the total across instantiations

Question 3
In the last question Alan showed Alyssa this code which keeps track of items for a shopping cart application:

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
Alyssa noticed that this will fail when update_quantity is called. Since quantity is an instance variable, it must be accessed with the @quantity notation when setting it. One way to fix this is to change attr_reader to attr_accessor and change quantity to self.quantity.

Is there anything wrong with fixing it this way?
Not technically, but this allows anyone to change the quantity.

Question 4
Let's practice creating an object hierarchy.

Create a class called Greeting with a single instance method called greet that takes a string argument and prints that argument to the terminal.

Now create two other classes that are derived from Greeting: one called Hello and one called Goodbye. The Hello class should have a hi method that takes no arguments and prints "Hello". The Goodbye class should have a bye method to say "Goodbye". Make use of the Greeting class greet method when implementing the Hello and Goodbye classes - do not use any puts in the Hello or Goodbye classes.

class Greeting
  def greet(greeting)
    puts greeting
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end

Question 5
You are given the following class that has been implemented:

class KrispyKreme
  attr_reader :filling_type, :glazing
  def initialize(filling_type, glazing)
    @filling_type = filling_type
    @glazing = glazing
  end

  def to_s
    first = @filling_type ? "#{@filling_type} : "Plain"
    second = @glazing ? " with #{@glazing}" : ''
    first + second
  end
end
And the following specification of expected behavior:

donut1 = KrispyKreme.new(nil, nil)
donut2 = KrispyKreme.new("Vanilla", nil)
donut3 = KrispyKreme.new(nil, "sugar")
donut4 = KrispyKreme.new(nil, "chocolate sprinkles")
donut5 = KrispyKreme.new("Custard", "icing")

puts donut1
  => "Plain"

puts donut2
  => "Vanilla"

puts donut3
  => "Plain with sugar"

puts donut4
  => "Plain with chocolate sprinkles"

puts donut5
  => "Custard with icing"
Write additional code for KrispyKreme such that the puts statements will work as specified above.

Question 6
If we have these two methods in the Computer class:

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    template
  end
end
and

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    self.template
  end
end
What is the difference in the way the code works?

In the first example, line 9 references the getter method
In the second, it references the instance variable

Question 7
How could you change the method name below so that the method name is more clear and less repetitive?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def light_status
    "I have a brightness level of #{brightness} and a color of #{color}"
  end

end

change it to 'status' there is no need to repeat the class name in the method.
